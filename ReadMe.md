### ðŸš§ Things That Might Do or just sound Cool (No Promises)  

- [ ] **ironically the contact me page doesn't actually contact me currently** 

- [ ] **A less sad footer :** The old one honestly was slick. 

- [ ] **Start my template engine arc :** For when I get tired of adding pages or i could just make it a nexus-cli plugIn in.
 
- [ ] **TTS mode for max immersion :** Because every portfolio deserves dramatic robot narration.

- [ ] **CSS that rewrites itself at midnight :** Chaos-driven development. Powered by moonlight and bad decisions.

- [ ] **Dark mode toggle that does nothing but judge you :**
Purely decorative. Like my productivity sometimes.

**Clone/fork/borrow the vibe** if this chaos speaks to you.
